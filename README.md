## Overview
This is my solution to the [Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage). 

### The challenge

- This is the 5/5 challenge of the Responsive Web Certification from freecodecamp. Basically consist on create a Personal Portfolio webpage using our creativity and aplying the knowledge adquired on the course. 
Then I had some requirements to follow in the development process and I have tested an passed all of it.

## My process
I chose to create my portfolio with a scalability perspective so as to put my future projects easily on it. I thought about all the design and I picked a minimalist style with my personal touch. It was great and I felt comfortable with the making-process. Then I have forked this repo for the stable version of this project and all the updates to my portfolio will happen on it. 

### Built with

- Desktop first workflow
- Responsive design
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SASS for nesting, module and custom properties
- Control version system using Git

### What I learned

This is my final project for this certifaction and I felt comfortable doing it. I started with an idea and I was be able to get it. I like the "final" result (The project will evolve with my way to become a frontend dev and has little things that I would like to improve in future with new knowledge that I'll adquire)
I used SASS to nesting and partials in order to module my code. I used a pattern to organize the project like an architecture but adapted for this small web.
Also I learned more about web design. Then I used git in order to handle the versions of the project.
I'll keep working on it!

### Continued development

I'm really excited to keep learning about frontend technologies, specially about going into javascript in order to create dynamic webs, I'll work on that when I feel confortable with my HTML/CSS skills. I'll keep learning git too because it's important and useful tool for co-working.
